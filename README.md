MODELLING OF SEMI-ARID RANGELANDS FOR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT WITH THE PYTHON API OF THE ILWIS GIS/RS SOFTWARE

Ilwis workshop at GeoPython2016, Basel 22-24 June 2016 ,  http://www.geopython.net/

12/07/2016 - updated to use Python 3.4 and ilwisobjects3.0



Windows compatible only, Python 3.4 32bit and Python 3.5 32bit

Look at installers/3.4/install.bat or installers/3.5/install.bat for installation instructions

If you are installing python 3.5 it is recommended to put it directly under the disk root (e.g. C:\python35_32)

During the installation of ilwisobjects for Python 3.5 you will need to insert the correct path to the python installation root

To run the interactive ipython notebook:

    open a windows commandline or powershell and change the current directory to the root folder (or open a command line
    directly in the folder with shift+right-click and select 'Open command window here'

    Then execute:

    py -3.4-32 -m notebook #or py -3.5-32 -m notebook

    after a few seconds a web browser will open; double-click geopython.ipynb
